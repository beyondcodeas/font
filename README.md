# Beyond font

A custom font based on the original Beyond Code logo, which is created around the perfect circle in the lowercase o. This font is intended to be used for future brands in the Beyond Group. Like this:

* **beyond:**[company]
  * eg. beyond:code
* [product/service]**:beyond**
  * eg. crm:beyond

This repository holds the svgs for all glyphs relevant, as well as the **FontForge** (.sfd) file and font files for installment in operating systems (otf) and for web (woff2)

## Usage of the font

In addition to use this font for logos, it might also be used for headings and quotes on the web and in printed materials. However, it is **by no means allowed** to use this for body text.

## Roadmap

The font is currently only available in regular font weight and style.

Considering to expand with these variants:

* monospace
  * fun to have our own font for coding!
* semibold
* thin
