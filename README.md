# Typeface Beyond

A custom typeface based on the original Beyond Code logo, which is created around the perfect circle in the lowercase o. This is intended to be used for future brands in the Beyond Group. Like this:

* **beyond:**[company]
  * eg. beyond:code
* [product/service]**:beyond**
  * eg. crm:beyond

This repository holds the svgs for all glyphs relevant, as well as the **FontForge** file (.sfd) and font files for installment in operating systems (.otf) and for web (.woff2)

## Usage of the typeface

In addition to use this typeface for logos, it might also be used for headings and quotes on the web and in printed materials. However, it is **by no means allowed** to be used on body text.

## Roadmap

The typeface is currently only available in regular weight and style.

Considering to expand with these variants:

* monospace
  * fun to have our own font for coding!
* semibold
* thin
