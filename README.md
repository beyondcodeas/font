# Beyond font

A custom font based on the original Beyond Code logo, which is based on the perfect circle in the lowercase o. This font is intended to be used for future brands in the Beyond Group, both companies like this: **beyond:[company]** and products/services like this: **[product]:beyond**

This repository holds the svgs for all glyphs relevant, as well as the FontForge (.sfd) file
